This is our submission for Deltahack 8.

Scheduler helps you keep track of your busy life!

## Inspiration
In university, you will often have many things due each week for all of your courses. Since discord is a popular means of communication with others and also sometimes a distraction, we decided to create a discord bot that would keep track of all your due dates and reminds you to complete your tasks

## What it does
Scheduler is a bot that allows you to add and remove tasks to a list to help you keep track of them. The bot also sends you notifications to remind you to complete your tasks.

## How we built it
We utilized discord.py and python to build our bot. To enable Scheduler to alway run, the bot is hosed on a Google Cloud Virtual Machine.

## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the entire process of building the bot, we did ran into several problems, however we were able to overcome them and have a working project. We spent quite some time on the process of retrieving the data from the database and returning it in a readable manner. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The following are the features we are proud of having implemented successfully:
- Users are able to store and view their lists
- Users can complete their tasks by deleting them from their list
- Bot is available 24/7

## What we learned
Given the short time frame we had to build this, we were still able to learn a considerable amount. One of the most important things we have learned is that communication is essential to building a project in a team. We learned technical skills as well, such as how to create discord bot.

## What's next for Scheduler
We have a lot of plans that we would like to implement to Scheduler someday. Some of these include creating a visual calendar that you can view the things due on specific days, being able to classify your work under certain categories, and also creating a priority list that the bot will notify you to complete as soon as possible.
